            <strong>Project Freelancer</strong> was a game that a few friends
            and I built for our 410 game programming class at the U of O. We
            felt that there weren't enough games out there which involved
            gameplay focused on non-combat core mechanics, and were inspired by
            the recent release of Pokemon Snap. We decided to make a game about
            being a freelance photographer in space. The game came together
            around the relaxing experience of wandering through large sectors of
            space, beautiful ambiance, and stopping to photograph space whales.

            was responsible for programming the essential architecture of the
            game, managing the way we approached problems, and

            programming the inregration of music into our game. You can find his
            other work at the github linked in his name. He has a special
            interest in parallel programming. I was respnsible for programming
            the movement in the game, inlcuding the player's ship, astral
            bodies, and the design of the AI in the game.

            We built the game in unity, and it was good opportunity to engage
            both with a game development engine that didn't take an excessive
            amount of training to us, and also with the C# language. I'm
            particularly happy with the way that we handled the manner in which
            entities in this game detected the player. It was also a fantastic
            opportunity to practice working on a medium scope project with a
            team of other programmers. I'm glad I made friends out of the
            process.
